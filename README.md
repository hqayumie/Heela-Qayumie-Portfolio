# Heela-Qayumie-Professional-Portfolio
## Description

The following project is a Professional Portfolio where I can showcase my projects for potential employers to view. My portfolio includes my name, a recent photo and links to sections about myself, my work and my contact information.You can click on the links in the navigation and the UI will scroll to the corresponding section. When you click on the images of my web application then you are taken to that deployed application (if it's completed or a link to my github as a place holder). Finally when you resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices you are presented with a responsive layout that adapts to your viewport
